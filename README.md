## 🔒 Privacy First
**Your financial data never leaves your device.** This tool runs entirely in your browser using local storage. No data is sent to any server. You can disconnect your internet and it will still work.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Multi-Bucket Logic:** Simulate Taxable, Roth, and 401k/IRA accounts growing independently.
* **The "Mountain" View:** Visualizes your entire financial lifecycle—from accumulation (working) to decumulation (retirement).
* **FIRE Targets:** Instantly see your Traditional, Early Retirement, and Coast FIRE numbers.
* **Smart Expenses:** Add one-time expenses (wedding, boat, college) to see their "Time Cost" (how many months of work they cost you).
* **Tax-Efficient Flow:** In retirement, the tool automatically draws from accounts in the most logical order (Taxable -> Roth -> 401k).

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Set Your Targets
Use the top-left panel to input your **Current Age**, **Retirement Age** (Accumulation Years), and **Life Expectancy**.

### 2. Add Asset Buckets
Click **+ Add Asset Bucket** to track different accounts.
* **Taxable:** Standard brokerage accounts.
* **Roth:** Post-tax contributions (Roth IRA/401k).
* **401k/IRA:** Pre-tax accounts (Traditional 401k/IRA).
* *Note:* You can set a "Stop Year" for specific contributions (e.g., stopping a side hustle after 5 years).

### 3. One-Time Expenses
Planning a big purchase? Add it to the **One-Time Expenses** widget. 
* The tool calculates the **Work Equivalent** (how much time you traded for this item).
* It calculates the **Opportunity Cost** (how much growth you lost by spending that money).

### 4. Analyze the Results
* **The Chart:** Hover over any year to see your total net worth and individual account balances.
* **The Tables:** * **Growth:** Shows your path to retirement. Look for the "🚀 CROSSOVER" badge when interest exceeds contributions.
    * **Retirement Flow:** Shows exactly which account your spending money comes from each year.
